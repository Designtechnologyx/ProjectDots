# ProjectDots
floor plan of only points/coordinates that define all the elements in a model

Currently there is only the single file PD.py which contains all parts of the project. We understand that having all modules in a single file may not be best practice but have chosen this to keep things simple as our groups skills grow.

Thank you for your efforts in growing your DTO comunity!
